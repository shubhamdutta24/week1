                    "Volcano" is the second episode of the animated television series South Park.
                    It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States in August 1997.
                    In the episode, Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny go on a hunting trip with Stan's uncle Jimbo and his war buddy Ned, unaware that a nearby volcano is about to erupt.

                    Written by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone (pictured), the episode was inspired by the 1997 disaster films Volcano and Dante's Peak, both of which Parker and Stone strongly disliked.
                    "Volcano" received generally positive reviews and was nominated for a 1997 Environmental Media Award.
                    Over one million viewers watched the original broadcast.
